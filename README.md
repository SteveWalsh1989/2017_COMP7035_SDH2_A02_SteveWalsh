# 2017_COMP7035_SDH2_A02_SteveWalsh


This project includes 3 sections that are part of the Linear data structures and algorithms module.

Part 1: Includes recursive methods as part of the divide and conquer algorithm including maxInt, isReverse, power, lucas series and drawing an image

Part 2: Includes more recursive methods as part of the divide and conquer algorithm including recursiveDisplay, smallerLists, biggerLists, concatenate, quickSort and MergeSort

Part 3: Includes methods for a greedy algorithm to work out minimum amount of coins needed of specific values which amounts to a specific value
